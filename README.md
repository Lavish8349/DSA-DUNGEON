# DSA-DUNGEON
My personal DSA grind zone — daily problems, patterns, and algorithmic madness. Slaying one bug at a time to keep the GitHub green and the brain sharp. 🧠⚔️ #100DaysOfCode #DSA

🏰 Welcome to the DSA Dungeon

This is my daily DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) practice repository — the place where I:
	•	Solve problems across platforms (LeetCode, Codeforces, Code360, etc.)
	•	Sharpen my coding skills with pattern recognisation and concepts
	•	Track progress and commit every day to stay consistent
	•	Document learnings & optimizations

📅 Goal: Keep the streak alive.
🎯 Focus: Clean code, brute-to-optimal transitions, and mastery of DSA.
🔥 Language: Mostly C++ .
